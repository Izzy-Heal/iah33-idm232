    <h1>Case Study</h1>
    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>The goal for this project was to create a recipe website using PHP as the main coding language. PHP is a language that I have never used before. 
        we also had to work with a database to create a site that could be changed by the user
    </p>
    <h1>Context and Challenge</h1>
    <p>This project was a class assignment for a scripting class. It was designed to show that I learned the basics of using PHP as a coding language. </p>
    <h1>Process and Insight</h1>
    <p>The start of this project was creating an initial design idea to build the website around. Building the HTML portion of the site went well for me and I was able to 
        create something that looked nice. When it came time to work with PHP I struggled a lot. I understood how everything was supposed to work, and I have a very good 
        grasp on coding in general, so it was incredibly frustrating to be unable to get the project to work. I was also scared to ask for help because the whole experience
        reminded me of my time as a computer science major when asking for help would involve getting judged by your professors or ridiculed by your peers.
    </p>
    <h1>Results</h1>
    <p class="bottom">Ultimatly I was unsuccessful with this project. Try as I might, I was not able to get the site to function. I wish I had been able to get the site to work as it was 
        an interesting assignment and I am ultimatly frustrated with myself for being unable to succeed with it. </p>
